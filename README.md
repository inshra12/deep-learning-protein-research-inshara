# 🧠 Deep Learning for Protein Research – Inshara Liaquat

Welcome to my repository, where I document my hands-on learning journey into deep learning and its application in bioinformatics — particularly focused on protein sequence analysis. This practical work is part of my preparation to pursue a fully funded PhD in South Korea in the field of AI for healthcare and cancer-related protein detection.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a strong understanding of AI and bioinformatics by:
- Practicing machine learning using Python
- Learning deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, Keras)
- Replicating published research on protein detection
- Preparing for TP53 mutation-focused applications in cancer
